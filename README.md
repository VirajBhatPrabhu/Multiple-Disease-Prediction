* Collected patient data on various diseases which affect organs such as Liver, Brain, Heart etc.
* Performed EDA on the datasets
* Created a custom function to test out different ML algorithms
* We selected AdaBoost, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, XGBoost, and Decision Tree Classifer as they gave highest accuracy, precision and recall with training as well as test datasets
* Built a client facing API using Flask
