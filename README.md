### The motivation behind this project

Providing accurate and accessible diagnoses is a fundamental challenge for global healthcare systems .An estimated 5% of outpatients receive the wrong diagnosis every year in U.S alone. Early and accurate diagnosis of diseases can help avoid long-term complications for the infected patient

### Area of Expertise 

 Detection and diagnosis of Brain Stroke,Heart Failure, Breast Cancer, Liver Disease, Prostate Cancer and Diabetes


### Project Timeline

* Collected patient data on various diseases which affect organs such as Liver, Brain, Heart etc.
* Performed EDA on the datasets
* Created a custom function to test out different ML algorithms
* We selected AdaBoost, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, XGBoost, and Decision Tree Classifer as they gave highest accuracy, precision and recall with training as well as test datasets
* Built a client facing API using Flask
